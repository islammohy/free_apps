## 🪟 Windows (.exe)

1. **Download**
   Grab the file named **`MP4‑to‑MP3‑Extractor‑win‑v1.0.zip`** from the latest GitHub release.

2. **Unzip**
   Right‑click > **Extract All…**  A folder with **`MP4‑to‑MP3‑Extractor.exe`** appears.

3. **Run**
   Double‑click the **.exe**. (First run: you may see “Windows protected your PC”. Click **More info → Run anyway** – the app is clean and unsigned.)

4. **Convert**

   * Click **Select Folder…** and point to the folder that holds your MP4s.
   * Choose your preferred **Bit‑rate** (192 k is a good default).
   * Hit **Start**.  Progress scrolls in the log; when you see **🏁 All done**, every video now has an **.mp3** next to it.

2. **Install**

   * Double‑click the .dmg to open it.

4. **Convert**
   Launch the app from Applications or Spotlight and follow the same three‑step flow as Windows: **Select Folder → Choose Bit‑rate → Start**.

## 🤔 FAQ

| Question                                   | Answer                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Does the original video change?**        | No. A new **.mp3** with the same name is created alongside each .mp4.                               |
| **What about .mkv or .mov?**               | This tool is MP4‑only. A universal extractor is on our roadmap.                                     |
| **“ffmpeg can’t be opened” error on mac?** | Rare, but if you see it: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow Anyway, then re‑open the app. |
| **Is it really free?**                     | Yes. Use it, share it, no strings attached.                                                         |
| **Where can I report a bug?**              | Open an Issue on the repo’s *Issues* tab with steps to reproduce and your OS version.               |
