## 🪟 Windows (.exe)

1. **Download**
   Grab **`MP4‑Batch‑Compressor‑win‑v1.0.zip`** from the latest GitHub release.

2. **Unzip**
   Right‑click → **Extract All…**. You’ll find **`MP4‑Batch‑Compressor.exe`** inside.

3. **Run**
   Double‑click the **.exe**.
   First time only, Windows SmartScreen may warn you—click **More info → Run anyway** (the app is safe but unsigned).

4. **Compress**

   * Click **Select Folder…** and point to the folder that holds your MP4s.
   * Move the **CRF** slider (18 = larger file/better quality, 32 = smaller file/lower quality).
   * Pick a **Preset** (e.g., *medium* is a good balance).
   * Hit **Start**. When the log finishes with **🏁 All done**, each original video now has a `_compressed.mp4` next to it.

> **Tip:** The app is fully portable—keep it on a USB stick and run it anywhere.

## 🍎 macOS (.app in .dmg)

1. **Download**
   Get **`MP4‑Batch‑Compressor‑mac‑v1.0.dmg`** from the release page.

2. **Install**

   * Double‑click the .dmg to mount it.
   * Drag **MP4 Batch Compressor.app** into **Applications**.

3. **First launch**
   Because the app isn’t from the App Store, macOS will ask the first time:
   *Right‑click the app → Open → Open*. You won’t need to do this again.

4. **Compress**
   Launch the app and follow the same steps as on Windows: **Select Folder → Set CRF/Preset → Start**.

> Tested on macOS 12 (Monterey) through macOS 14 (Sonoma) on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## 🤔 FAQ

| Question                                | Answer                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Does it overwrite my originals?**     | Never. New files get `_compressed.mp4` added to the name.                      |
| **How much smaller will my videos be?** | Typical savings are 30–70 % at CRF 24 with little visible quality loss.        |
| **Can I cancel mid‑way?**               | Just close the window; finished files stay, in‑process files remain unaltered. |
| **Does audio quality change?**          | The original audio stream is copied untouched.                                 |
| **Where to report bugs?**               | Open an Issue on the GitHub repo with your OS version and steps to reproduce.  |
